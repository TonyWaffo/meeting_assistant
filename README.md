# Meeting Assistant Project

## Project Overview
The Meeting Assistant is a web application designed to assist with meetings by handling tasks like transcription and user queries on these transcripts. The project consists of a backend (Python/Flask) and a frontend (React.js) that work together seamlessly.

## Project Structure

### Backend
**Folder:** `backend`

- **app**
  - `__init__.py`: Initializes the app.
  - `models.py`: Defines database models.
  - `audio_routes.py`: Handles routes related to transcription uploads.
  - `auth.py`: Manages authentication-related routes.
  - `fireflies.py`: Contains logic for Fireflies integration.
  - `routes.py`: Manages routes related to meeting creation, sending messages, getting meetings, and handling user queries.
- **migrations**: Contains database migration files.
- **uploads**: Temporarily stores files being transcribed.
- **venv**: Virtual environment.
- **__pycache__**: Folder is automatically created by Python to store compiled versions of .py files
- `app.py`: Entry point for the app, calling `__init__.py`.
- `config.py`: Holds environment-specific variables (e.g., development vs production).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies.
- `Procfile`: Used for deployment on platforms like Heroku.
- `runtime.txt`: Specifies the Python runtime version (useful for Heroku).
- `node_modules`: Auto-generated by npm/yarn for any backend dependencies.

### Database Setup
Ensure the database is set up and the correct URL is provided in the .env file. Run migrationsDatabase Setup if needed:
`flask db upgrade`


### Frontend
**Folder:** `frontend`

- **dist**: Contains the production build of the frontend.
- **public**: Contains static assets like the favicon and images.
- **src**: Contains the source code for the frontend:
  - `api`: Handles API communication.
  - `hooks`: Custom React hooks.
  - `utils`: Utility functions.
  - `redux`: Manages app state using Redux.
  - `components`: Contains reusable UI components (JSX and CSS).
  - `pages`: Represents the main views of the app.
  - `App.jsx`: Main app component.
  - `main.jsx`: Root file that renders the app.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python
- Node.js and npm/yarn
- Virtual Environment (recommended)
- Ollama model (e.g., Mistral) — Pull the model to match the one used in the answer_question method.
- FFmpeg — Required for compressing videos into audio.

### SERVER_URL with Ngrok (dev mode)
SERVER_URL is used in audio_routes.py to access audio files in the uploads/ folder via an HTTP link. Since localhost isn't accessible from outside your machine, you can expose the local server with ngrok:

ngrok http 5000

This will give you a public URL like:

https://e362-135-19-4-239.ngrok-free.app

Set this URL as SERVER_URL in the .env file.

Example usage to access an audio in the uploads folder when transcription is occuring:

https://e362-135-19-4-239.ngrok-free.app/uploads/20250325_004526_f8117f3f2d7c43efb6a32f2c02c15352_3_MINUTES_Pour_Transformer_Ta_VIE___H5_Motivation.mp3

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
```

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the backend:
```bash
python app.py
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Run the frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
